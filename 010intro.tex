Seismic risk assessment in earthquake engineering tends to focus on buildings, bridges, and the performance of infrastructure systems. For measuring the performance of transportation systems, researchers typically use engineering-based metrics such as the post-earthquake connectivity loss, which quantifies the decrease in the number of origins or generators connected to a destination node~\cite[e.g.,][]{duenas-osorio_seismic_2007}, or the post-earthquake travel distance between two locations of interest~\cite[e.g.,][]{chang_probabilistic_2000}. These frameworks have provided insight into seismic vulnerability and possible risk mitigation, but do not directly quantify ramifications for people. 

In the field of vulnerability sciences, researchers have long stressed the importance of the impact on human welfare from earthquakes. For example, Bolin and Stanford write that,```Natural' disasters have more to do with the social, political, and economic aspects than they do with the environmental hazards that trigger them. Disasters occur at the interface of vulnerable people and hazardous environments"~\cite{bolin_northridge_1998}. A recent World Bank and United Nations report echoed this idea that the effects on human welfare turn natural hazards into disasters~\cite{the_world_bank_and_the_united_nations_natural_2010}.
Historical events demonstrate the complex social effects of earthquakes. For example, on one hand the 1994 Northridge earthquake caused major damage to nine bridges, which, while significant, represented only 0.5\% of the bridges estimated by Caltrans to have experienced significant shaking~\cite{california._dept._of_transportation._post_earthquake_investigation_team_northridge_1994}. On the other hand, over half of businesses reported closing after the earthquake, with 56\% citing the ``inability of employees to get to work" as a reason~\cite{tierney_business_1997}. Furthermore, the total economic cost of transport-related interruptions (``commuting, inhibited customer access, and shipping and supply disruptions") from this earthquake is estimated at 2.16 billion USD (2014)~\cite{gordon_transport-related_1998}, using the consumer price index to account for inflation.

%~\cite{tierney_foreshadowing_2006}, the author writes that "Disasters result not from physical disaster agents, such as hurricanes, tornados, and earthquakes, but rather from the juxtaposition of three factors: (1) the disaster agent itself--whether a hurricane, earthquake, tornado, or some technological or human-induced event; (2) the physical setting affected by the disaster, including characteristics of the built environment (e.g., structures not built to survive the physical impact of the disaster agent) and environmental features that serve to either mitigate the effects of disasters or make them more severe (e.g., diminished wetlands that could have cushioned the impacts of Katrina); and (3) population vulnerability, a complex construct that includes such factors as; proximity to physical disaster impacts; material resources (income and wealth); race, ethnicity, gender, age; knowledge concerning recommended safety measures; and factors associated with social and cultural capital" and 


Some researchers have measured the impact of earthquakes on transportation infrastructure using the cumulative extra time needed for travel due to damage, sometimes called travel time delay~\cite[e.g.,][]{kiremidjian_seismic_2007,jayaram_efficient_2010}. This performance measure captures basic re-routing due to road closures and identifies roads more likely to be congested.  Travel time approximately measures impact on people, but does not capture the fact that some destinations and trips have higher value than others. It also focuses on aggregate regional effects rather than individual communities and demographic groups. Others have considered the qualitative criteria-based metric  ``disruption index''~\cite{oliveira_concept_2012}, but this does not provide a quantitative link between physical damage to infrastructure and resulting human ramifications. Other work has looked at resiliency, but defined it in pure engineering terms, such as percentage of a road network that is functional~\cite{bocchini_restoration_2012}. Outside of transportation systems, some researchers have investigated the interplay between earthquake damage to the electric power and wastewater networks, and the usability of houses and other buildings~\cite{cavalieri_quantitative_2012}.

Thus, travel time increase as discussed in the literature typically does not capture the possibility that travel demand may change depending on the magnitude of earthquake-related damages.

%bolin_northridge_1998: 'Natural' disasters have more to do with the social, political, and economic aspects than they do with the environmental hazards that trigger them. Disasters occur at the interface of vulnerable people and hazardous environments. This book concentrates on the social aspects of disaster, focusing on the most expensive disaster to date in US history, the Northridge earthquake of 1994, to examine the facets of vulnerability and post-disaster recovery strategies. Surveying the historical and contemporary aspects of life in Southern California the author explains how vulnerability to disaster has been shaped by more than a century of immigration, urbanization, environmental transformations, and economic development." He writes, that the study of disasters "is not an isolated specialty, but [is] necessarily connected to...issues of development, environmental sustainaiblity, urban geography, political ecology, and critical social theory."

In contrast to the work on transportation-related seismic risk, urban planning has a long tradition of studying the impact on people of events and policy~\cite{chapin_urban_1970}. Accessibility is one popular metric to measure the impact of different transportation network scenarios, and it measures how easily people can get to desirable destinations, which is one measure of social impact~\cite{niemeier_accessibility:_1997}.  Within urban planning, accessibility has been measured in many ways, including individual accessibility, economic benefits of accessibility, and mode-destination accessibility~\cite{geurs_accessibility_2004}. The mode-destination accessibility is computed by taking the  log value of the sum of a function of the utilities of each destination over all possible destinations and travel modes, where the utility decreases if getting to that destination is more costly or time-intensive~\cite{handy_measuring_1997}. This choice of accessibility definition is particularly useful for quantifying the impacts of disasters such as earthquakes, because certain destinations might be more critical for people in certain locations or from certain socio-economic groups. However, this accessibility measure has not previously been linked to risk assessment. In addition,  the majority of work to date assumes that travel demand and mode choice will remain unchanged after a future earthquake, which historical data suggests is not the case~\cite{gordon_transport-related_1998}. A first step towards considering variable demand is work in the literature that varies demand by applying a constant multiplicative factor on all pre-earthquake travel demand~\cite{kiremidjian_seismic_2007}, but again this approach lacks any resolution at the geographic or socio-economic level.

%%In addition to the challenge of linking engineering damage to people, another less-studied topic in the literature is how to model reasonably comprehensive transportation networks for risk assessment. 
%While recent work has investigated the interdependencies between different infrastructure networks, such as electric power and water distribution~\cite{hernandez-fajardo_probabilistic_2013},  a less well-understood topic is the interdependencies within the transportation system itself. For example, the collapse of a highway bridge may close a transit line if the bridge crosses the transit line. Furthermore, the majority of work to date assumes that travel demand and mode choice will remain unchanged after a future earthquake, which historical data suggests is not the case~\cite{gordon_transport-related_1998}. A first step towards considering variable demand is work in the literature that varies demand by applying a constant multiplicative factor on all pre-earthquake travel demand~\cite{kiremidjian_seismic_2007}. Thus, the prior work suggests three areas of further investigation: 1) the risk of post-earthquake accessibility losses for different people and communities in a region, 2) the impact to the risk assessment results of modeling interdependent transit systems, and 3) the consequences of capturing varying travel demand and different travel modes in the analysis. 

In this paper, we develop a framework for coupling mode-destination accessibility with a quantitative seismic-risk assessment to identify at-risk populations and measure the accompanying impacts on human welfare. 
We illustrate our approach with a case study of the San Francisco Bay Area transportation network, including highways, local roads, and public transportation lines.
This study analyzes a set of forty hazard-consistent earthquake scenarios, ground-motion intensity maps, and damage maps, as introduced in~\cite{miller_seismic_2014,miller_ground-motion_2014}.
%First, we simulate earthquake scenarios. Adding on spatial correlation, we then simulate ground-motion intensity maps. 
%From these, we generate damage maps. 
%We then compute basic network performance (travel time delay) with an efficient travel model, which includes highways and major local roads and fixed demand. Using the optimization procedure we proposed in~\cite{miller_ground-motion_2014}, we select a subset of these maps for modeling in a high-fidelity transportation model used by the local transportation authorities. 
For each of these damage maps, we model damage with an agent-based transportation model used by the local transportation authorities that considers the impacts of damage to bridges, roads, and transit lines, and captures variable user demand. 
%While these more comprehensive models are already used in practice for general transportation planning, we extend the models to seismic risk assessment by creating an automated method for damaging and analyzing networks, in order to estimate risk in an event-based probabilistic risk framework. 
%The key differences, however, are that we simulate earthquake damage to bridges, roads, and transit lines; and that we automate the procedure to run many events in an event-based probabilistic risk framework. 
%First, we simulate a large set of earthquake scenarios, ground-motion intensity maps, and damage maps. Then, we use optimization to select a subset of the maps. After that, for each of the selected maps, we use a high-fidelity, activity-based travel model to compute the mode-destination accessibility. The model includes the road network, transit networks, walking and biking options, variable travel demand, and mode choice. 
Then, with this model, we estimate losses in accessibility for 12 socio-economic groups and for a number of communities within the study region. 
%We find that predicted post-earthquake accessibility losses between people living in geographically-differing communities vary more than the accessibility losses between people of different economic classes living within a given community. One driver of this trend is that people living in communities with higher proportions of foot traffic are predicted to be less impacted by accessibility losses  than people in other communities. The results lay the foundation for targeting risk mitigation using this improved understanding of where the at-risk communities are located and what may drive this risk.
