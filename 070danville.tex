%While physical conditions contribute significantly to the risk of Pacifica, CA, trip length and bridge vulnerability play a big role in the accessibility risk for Danville, CA (Figure~\ref{fig:equity_study_area}). 

% We will first examine the trip length characteristics for Danville. %As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:time_distance_pdfs}, t
Danville is a suburban community with many residents commuting large distances by car. The average length of a trip from Danville is 85\% longer than the average over all trips in the study region, with a relatively high proportion of trips taking more than 60 minutes and traveling over 40 miles. These longer trips have more opportunities to be impacted by road closures, because more roads and bridges will be used to complete the trip. Moreover, many Danville trips are via highways, which increases the likelihood of crossing (damage prone) highway bridges.

Bridge damage is important for many regions, including Danville, because the percentage of car-based trips is high (85\% of all trips from Danville, which is approximately average for all TAZs). For all three simulations shown in Figure~\ref{fig:scen_acc}, some bridges in the Oakland area are damaged and thus closed. In addition, in the first two simulations, there are closures to the north of Danville, which represents one of the two main travel routes from Danville. There are also scattered closed bridges to the west of Danville, a top travel corridor for people of Danville because of the workplace centers in San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose (all to the west). As for transit, in the first two events, all BART lines are closed, so there are limited alternatives to the popular road routes. The result is that the residents of Danville have reduced access to their normal destinations after these events. 
Looking at the rate of bridge damage across all of the earthquake simulations in Figure~\ref{fig:scen_acc}{g}, we see that bridges in the Oakland area and to the north of Danville are particularly likely to be damaged. This suggests that Danville's proximity to  vulnerable bridges contributes to its accessibility risk.
